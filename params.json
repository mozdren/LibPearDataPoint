  "tagline": "A library for data sharing using a Peer-to-Peer system over Ethernet. It simplifies the networking for developers in such a way, that the developer basically creates variables, sets values, and those are immediately available in a all Peer (Pear) applications. NOTE: See that Pear in the name (not Peer)? Sounds similar, but it's different. Neat, isn't it? ;)",
  "body": "### Why LibPearDataPoint\r\n\r\nDo you find it annoying when you need to share data between applications over network. Creating sockets and implementing protocols for communication basically isn't your cup of tea? Well, you have come to a right place. This C# library is designed to help you forget about networking implementation. I have just done that for you! You only need to copy the library and create a reference in your project. Then you can just simply create DataItems (something like a network variables) with specific names and read the values in other app which runs over the same network. Sure you have tools like waiting for DataItem availability or subscription to changes. You need something more? Just name it and I will see what can be done. Enjoy the lib, and I hope it helps ;)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSo far this is a solo project by me (Karel Mozdren @mozdren). But who knows...\r\n",
