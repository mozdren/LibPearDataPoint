# LibPearDataPoint
A library for data sharing using a Peer-to-Peer system over Ethernet. It simplifies the networking for developers in such a way, that the developer basically creates variables, sets values, and those are immediately available in a all Peer (Pear) applications. NOTE: See that Pear in the name (not Peer)? Sounds similar, but it's different. Neat, isn't it? ;)
